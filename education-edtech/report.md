# 🎓 Education & EdTech (B2B) — Sector Deep Dive v2
**Date:** February 9, 2026 | **Sector Index:** 5

## THE STORY

Picture this: India has 260 million students and a workforce where **only 42.6% of graduates are employable**. That's not a typo — more than half of every graduating class walks out with degrees that don't translate into jobs. Meanwhile, companies are screaming for talent, paying premium salaries to the few who have practical skills. The gap? It's worth billions.

The B2C EdTech story (Byju's, Unacademy, Vedantu) is well-known — and it's mostly a cautionary tale. Byju's went from $22 billion valuation to effectively worthless in under 3 years. But here's what most people miss: **B2B EdTech quietly grew 20%+ through the same period**. While consumer apps burned through marketing dollars acquiring students who churned, enterprise learning platforms were signing multi-year deals with companies desperate to upskill their workforce.

Think of it like this: B2C EdTech is like selling gym memberships (high churn, low engagement). B2B EdTech is like being the corporate wellness provider — you sign contracts with HR, get paid regardless of whether employees show up, and renewals happen automatically. The India corporate LMS market is racing toward **₹1,400 crore by 2035** at 9.27% CAGR, while the broader India LMS market (including schools, universities) will hit **$5.15 billion by 2033** at 21.66% CAGR.

## 1. DEEP DIVE: The School Management Tech Stack

The B2B EdTech space has three distinct layers, each with different economics:

### Layer 1: School Operations (SIS/ERP)
**What it does:** Admissions, fees, attendance, transport, timetable, parent communication
**Why it matters:** Schools can't function without this — it's mission-critical infrastructure
**Key insight:** Most Indian schools still use Excel + WhatsApp. The TAM is massive but sales cycles are brutal (decisions made by trust committees, not individual buyers)

### Layer 2: Classroom Tech (LMS/Content)
**What it does:** Lesson planning, content delivery, assessments, homework
**Why it matters:** This is where learning outcomes actually happen
**Key insight:** Content is NOT the moat — distribution is. Whoever owns the teacher relationship wins.

### Layer 3: Outcomes Layer (Assessment/Analytics)
**What it does:** Testing, diagnostics, learning gap identification, board exam prep
**Why it matters:** Parents pay for results, not platforms
**Key insight:** The real opportunity is connecting all three layers — no one has done this well in India yet.

**Tech Stack Reality Check:**
- Most schools run 4-5 different disconnected tools
- Data doesn't flow between them
- Teachers spend 2+ hours daily on admin work that could be automated
- The integration opportunity is worth more than any individual layer

## 2. YC DIRECTORY — Decoded

Recent YC EdTech companies reveal clear thesis shifts:

| Company | What It Does | Buzzword Translation |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Kaiden AI** | AI-powered school management | ChatGPT for principals — automates admin decisions |
| **HoloKitab** | AR-based learning | AR textbooks — kids point phones at books, see 3D models |
| **Zynergic** | Educational video games | Gamified learning — Roblox meets homework |
| **youHQ** | Student well-being platform | Mental health tracking for schools — early warning system |
| **EduTAMS** | Education management systems | All-in-one school ERP |
| **Acely** | AI tutoring ($10M ARR) | Personalized math/reading coach — spinout from Juni |

**YC's Current EdTech Thesis:**
1. LLMs finally make 1:1 tutoring scalable (replicating human tutor experience)
2. B2B + B2B2C hybrid models (sell AI tutoring to schools, not just parents)
3. Outcomes-based pricing (pay for results, not subscriptions)
4. Mental health + academic performance combined

## 3. INDUSTRY NEWS (Jan-Feb 2026)

**Correction Phase Deepens:**
- EdTech funding stayed at "depressed levels" relative to 2021-22 peak (Crunchbase, Nov 2025)
- However, AI-for-education companies are excluded from traditional EdTech counts — they're raising under "AI infrastructure"
- India startup funding hit $11B in 2025, but investors grew "more selective" — fewer deals, bigger checks (TechCrunch)

**Key Developments:**
- **Classplus** pivoted from pure SaaS to test prep content (Inc42, Jul 2025) — signal that B2B SaaS alone isn't enough
- **LEAD School** maintaining $172M raised, valued at ₹6,350 crore — largest B2B EdTech in India
- **Disprz** (corporate LMS) won "EdTech Startup of the Year 2022" — now serving Amazon, HDFC, Indian Oil, Standard Chartered
- **Royal Enfield + Tenneo (G-Cube LMS)** partnership: 2,500+ dealer training users across India/LATAM (2024)

**The AI Pivot:**
- Generic LMS platforms are becoming commoditized
- Winners are integrating generative AI for:
  - Auto-grading assignments
  - Generating personalized practice problems
  - Creating flashcards/summaries from lectures
  - Real-time translation for regional language delivery

## GRAVEYARD 💀 — Failed Companies

### 1. Byju's ($22B → $0)
**Timeline:** Peaked 2021, collapsed 2024
**Cause of Death:** 
- Aggressive acquisition spree ($2B+ on WhiteHat Jr, Toppr, Aakash)
- Unit economics never worked — $150+ CAC for ₹5K course
- Loan restructuring, missed payments, lawsuits
- Valuation cut 95% by BlackRock

**Lesson:** Growth ≠ business. B2C EdTech has fundamentally broken economics without outcomes-based pricing.

### 2. Lido Learning (Raised $25M → Shutdown Feb 2022)
**Cause of Death:**
- Funding deal collapsed at last minute
- 1,200 employees laid off with no notice
- Parents couldn't get refunds
- Founder Sahil Sheth went from hero to villain overnight

**Lesson:** Don't burn through cash expecting the next round. Always have 18 months runway.

### 3. WhiteHat Jr (Acquired for $300M → Gutted)
**Cause of Death:**
- Aggressive sales tactics, false promises
- 800 employees quit over RTO mandate
- Product didn't deliver outcomes
- Parent company (Byju's) couldn't support it

**Lesson:** Marketing hype without product-market fit is suicide. Kids coding isn't as big as hyped.

### 4. Vedantu (Multiple layoffs, valuation cut 90%)
**Timeline:** 600+ layoffs in 2022
**Cause of Death:**
- Grew too fast, hired too many
- Live classes model is capital intensive
- Couldn't compete with YouTube/free content

**Lesson:** Synchronous learning is hard to scale. Async + AI > live teachers.

### 5. Toppr (Acquired by Byju's, shut down)
**Cause of Death:**
- Lost identity after acquisition
- Best talent left
- Product absorbed into Byju's mess

**Lesson:** Acquisitions rarely work in EdTech. Culture clash kills products.
