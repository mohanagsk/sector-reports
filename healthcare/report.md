# Daily Sector Deep Dive #2: Healthcare & HealthTech (India B2B)
**Date:** Feb 5, 2026 | **Sector:** Healthcare, HealthTech, MedTech

## THE STORY

Imagine you run a 50-bed hospital in Jaipur. You have 3 doctors handling 200 patients/day, paper records stuffed in files, insurance claims rejected because of coding errors, and no idea if your hospital is making or losing money this month. Now multiply this by 1.5 million hospitals and clinics across India. That's healthcare B2B.

This is a $30 billion innovation market growing to $60 billion by 2028. But here's the twist: investor money is LEAVING consumer healthtech (apps, telemedicine) and FLOODING into B2B infrastructure — the boring plumbing that actually makes hospitals work.

## MARKET SNAPSHOT

- India healthcare market: **$180B** (FY23) → **$320B** by FY28 (12% CAGR)
- Digital health market: **$14.5B** (2024) → **$76-107B** by 2033 (25% CAGR)
- HealthTech SaaS: **1,313 startups** in India (Tracxn)
- B2B Hospital supplies alone: **$2.5B** segment
- Healthtech funding dropped to 5-year low in 2025 — investors want unit economics, not GMV
- 30% of healthtech VC now flows into MedTech & diagnostics (Bain)
- Doctor-to-patient ratio: **1:1,500** (should be 1:1,000)
- **76% specialist doctor shortage** at Community Health Centres
- 1.7 nurses per 1,000 people (WHO recommends 3)

## VC THESIS — HOW THE SMART MONEY THINKS

**a16z (Bio + Health):** Their entire thesis is "Moore's Law vs Eroom's Law." Tech gets cheaper exponentially. Healthcare gets MORE expensive exponentially. The winning companies are those that turn human services into compute — replacing ₹2000/hour doctor time with ₹2/hour AI time. They launched a $500M Biotech fund with Eli Lilly in Jan 2025. They back "AI copilots that augment, not replace" doctors.

**General Catalyst (Health Assurance):** Committed $1.7B+ to their "Health Assurance" thesis — the idea that healthcare should work like insurance-for-wellness, not sick-care. They invested $1B into companies like Commure, Transcarent, and Hippocratic AI. Their filter: "Does this product work within how care is ACTUALLY delivered, not how VCs imagine it should be?"

**Bain & Company:** India healthcare innovation is $30B today, hitting $60B by FY28. The shift: from B2C (telemedicine, pharmacy delivery) to B2B (hospital SaaS, diagnostics AI, clinical workflows). 80-90% of deal volume is seed/Series A — the space is EARLY.

**Key insight from all three:** B2C healthtech is a bloodbath (see PharmEasy below). B2B healthtech infrastructure is where the real money is going.

## GRAVEYARD — WHO DIED & WHY 💀

**PharmEasy** — The cautionary tale. Valued at $5.6B in 2021 during COVID hype. Today? $456M. A 92% crash. What happened? They borrowed ₹2,500 crore from Goldman Sachs to acquire Thyrocare (a diagnostics lab) for $600M — an amount now LARGER than PharmEasy's entire valuation. They couldn't build a sustainable supply chain, lost the trust battle (people still prefer their local chemist), and got crushed by Blinkit/Zepto delivering medicines in 10 minutes. Lesson: **Don't buy companies with borrowed money during a bubble.**

**mFine** — Raised $48M, fired 75% of staff (600 people) in 2022. Teleconsultation worked during COVID when people couldn't go outside. The moment lockdowns ended, patients went right back to their doctors. Lesson: **COVID adoption ≠ real adoption. If the product only works when people are locked in their homes, it's not a product — it's a workaround.**

**Lybrate** — Still alive but barely. Same teleconsultation bet. In India, talking to a doctor through a screen feels wrong to most people, especially in Tier 2-3. Trust is built in person. Lesson: **Don't fight culture — work with it.**

## WHO'S WINNING ✅

**Qure.ai** — AI for reading X-rays and CT scans. Revenue: ₹140 crore (FY24), losses narrowing. Planning IPO in 2 years. Why it works: They don't replace doctors — they help radiologists read 100 scans/hour instead of 20. Deployed in 90+ countries. The "Grammarly for radiology."

**Eka Care** — Building electronic medical records (EMR) for India. Backed by Hummingbird, 3one4. Instead of making patients download an app, they give doctors a simple tool to digitize records. Think "Notion for patient data." Works because it starts with the doctor, not the patient.

**5C Network** — AI radiology platform connecting rural hospitals to urban radiologists. A hospital in Dharwad can get a CT scan read by a specialist in Bangalore within hours. Like "Uber for radiology reading."

**HealthPlix** — EMR platform used by 25,000+ doctors. Offline-first (works without internet), AI-powered prescription engine. Won because they understood Indian doctors don't have reliable WiFi.
