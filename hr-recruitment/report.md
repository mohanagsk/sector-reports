## THE STORY

Imagine you're an HR manager at a 200-person manufacturing company in Pune. Your mornings start with WhatsApp messages from recruiters, your afternoons are spent chasing attendance spreadsheets, and your evenings are dedicated to the compliance nightmare that is EPF/ESIC filings. You're not doing "human resources" — you're doing "paperwork resources."

Now picture this: On November 21, 2025, India's government dropped a bomb — **four new Labour Codes came into effect simultaneously**. Overnight, everything from how you calculate overtime to how you structure take-home pay changed. Companies scrambled. HR teams panicked. Lawyers got rich.

This is the opportunity.

India's HR tech market is **₹9,400 Cr ($1.12B) today** and racing toward **₹19,320 Cr ($2.3B) by 2033**. But here's the twist: 93% of India's 63 million MSMEs still manage HR on Excel and WhatsApp. The gap between where enterprises are (Darwinbox, Keka) and where SMBs are stuck (chaos) is massive.

The winners won't just build software — they'll be the ones who understand that Indian HR isn't about copying Rippling. It's about knowing that a factory owner in Ludhiana doesn't want a "unified HCM platform" — he wants someone to tell him if he's going to get fined next month.

## 1. DEEP DIVE: The New Labour Codes Revolution

### What Changed on November 21, 2025

India consolidated 29 labor laws into **4 Labour Codes**:

1. **Code on Wages 2019** — Redefines "wages" (basic must be ≥50% of CTC)
2. **Code on Social Security 2020** — Unified PF, ESI, gratuity framework
3. **Industrial Relations Code 2020** — Strike rules, layoff procedures
4. **OSH Code 2020** — Safety standards, now apply to 10+ employee companies

### The Compliance Chaos

- **CTC Restructuring Required:** If basic salary < 50% of gross, companies must restructure. This affects take-home pay calculations for millions.
- **Digital Registers Mandatory:** Paper muster rolls → digital attendance
- **Unified Compliance Portal:** Single digital return instead of 20+ separate filings
- **Gig Worker Coverage:** For the first time, gig and platform workers get social security

### Why This Creates Opportunity

Every SMB in India needs to:
- Restructure salary components
- Switch to digital attendance
- Update appointment letters
- Recalculate PF/gratuity liabilities

**The 6-month window (Nov 2025 - May 2026) is the land grab.**

| **Deel** | W2019 | EOR + global payroll (competes with Rippling) | 5,000 employees, mega unicorn |
| **Rippling** | W2017 | HR + IT + Finance unified | $1.2B raised, Sequoia-backed |
| **Checkr** | S2014 | Background checks via API | 800 employees |
| **Tsenta** | S2026 | Desktop app that auto-applies to jobs | 2 employees, brand new |

## 4. IDEA VARIATIONS: 10 Product Versions

## 5. DIFFERENTIATION: How Can WE Do It Differently?

### Price Play
- Darwinbox: ₹150-300/employee/month for enterprise
- Keka: ₹60-100/employee/month for mid-market
- **Gap:** ₹0-30/employee/month for SMBs with <50 employees

### Speed Play
- Current background checks: 3-7 days
- AI-powered verification: <24 hours (using public databases, employer calls via AI)

### Audience Play
- Everyone's chasing IT/services companies
- **Neglected:** Manufacturing, construction, logistics, retail
- These sectors employ 70% of India but get 10% of HR tech attention

### Tech Play
- Current: SaaS dashboards that HR managers use
- **Opportunity:** AI agents that factory owners talk to on WhatsApp
- "Baat karo, kaam ho jaye" vs "Log in and navigate 15 tabs"

### Distribution Play
- Current: Sales teams calling HR managers
- **Opportunity:** Partner with CAs and payroll consultants (they have SMB relationships)

## GRAVEYARD 💀: Failed Companies & Why They Died

### 1. leap.club (2020-2025)
**What:** Women's networking + job platform

### 2. CodeParrot (YC-backed, 2022-2025)
**What:** AI developer productivity  
**Raised:** $500K  
**Why it died:** "Pivot hell" — couldn't find PMF, hit $1,500 MRR ceiling  
**Lesson:** Speed matters. If you're stuck pivoting for a year, you're dead.

### 3. ANS Commerce (Flipkart-acquired, 2017-2025)
**What:** D2C enablement platform  
**Why it died:** Acquired then shut down — didn't fit Flipkart's strategy

### 4. GenWise (2023-2025)
**What:** Elder care lifestyle app  
**Raised:** Z47-backed  
**Why it died:** 30L users, ₹1 Cr revenue, ₹12 Cr loss — couldn't monetize seniors  
**Lesson:** Users ≠ revenue. Especially with non-paying demographics.

### 5. Hike (Gaming pivot, 2012-2025)
**What:** Messaging → Web3 gaming
